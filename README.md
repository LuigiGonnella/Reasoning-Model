# Reasoning Model - Exercises Repository

This repository contains solutions and implementations for the exercises provided by the book **"Build a Reasoning Model (From Scratch)"**.

## Overview

The code and notebooks in this repository explore the fundamentals of building reasoning models from first principles. Through hands-on exercises and practical implementations, you will develop a deep understanding of how reasoning models work and how to build them from scratch.

## Contents

- **main.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook containing exercise solutions and implementations
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies required to run the notebooks and code
- **CH2/qwen3/**: Additional resources and tokenizer files for working with models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone or navigate to this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook to view and execute the exercises:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## About the Book

This repository follows the exercises and concepts from **"Build a Reasoning Model (From Scratch)"**, which provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing reasoning models using modern deep learning techniques.

## Structure

Each exercise builds upon previous concepts, progressively covering:
- Foundational reasoning model architecture
- Training and optimization techniques
- Practical implementation strategies
- Real-world applications and extensions

## Notes

- All code is executed in Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
- Refer to the main.ipynb file for detailed explanations and step-by-step guidance
- Make sure all dependencies from requirements.txt are installed before running cells

## License

This repository contains educational implementations based on exercises from "Build a Reasoning Model (From Scratch)".
